    "# EGD103 Assignment 1 - The Harvesting Robot\n",
    "In this assignment, you will be applying some tasks involving the programming of a small robot that moves in 2D space. The robot is required to collect 10 objects that appear in a 100 tile x 100 tile grid. The project is inspired by harvesting robots which are becoming increasingly popular in agricultural applications.\n",

    "In order to simplify this programming project, we have placed some restrictions on the robot's motion. The robot is limited to moving one tile on the grid at a time and is limited to moving in four directions: up, down, left and right. Objects can only be placed on grid tiles and will be collected when the robot is on the same tile as the object. You can view the videos uploaded to Canvas to get an idea of what the final product from this project should look like.\n",

    "* Part 2 gets you to write actions for the robot to perform: locate, move and collect. These require content covered in weeks 1-4.\n",
    "* Part 3 gets you to initialise a board state for the objects and then simulate the robot collecting each object. These require content covered in weeks 1-5.\n",
